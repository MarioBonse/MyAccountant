A web app for manage accounting for an ice cream shop :icecream: .
User can introduce the products they have bought, the recipes the revenue, electric and water bill and other expenses. 
Then they can visualize the daily results and more advance statistics are easily implementable. 

:it: Unfortunately It's in Italian :trollface: 

It's all implemented in javascript, php and mySQL for database management. It doesn't use any external library :fearful:
